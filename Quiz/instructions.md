A teacher records the grades of students in a class. Some students passed, but the teacher only wants to keep track of the grades below 75.
Write a C program that will
1. Store the original grades in array allGrades[].
2. Transfer the failing grades to array failingGrades[].
- use pointers and double pointers only in transferring the grades from allGrades[] to failingGrades[], no subscripts or indexes.
3. Sort the failing grades array from lowest to highest
4. Print the sorted failing grades
