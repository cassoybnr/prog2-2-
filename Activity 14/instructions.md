A teacher wants to record and manage student grades. Since the number of students i not fixed. The teacher needs a program that can handle grade dynamically.

Write a C program that will first, ask the user for the number of students then input the grades - use calloc()

Then, create a menu interface that will display options for the following features:
1. Display all the grades and calculates the average grade.
2. Allow the teacher to update the grade of a specific student.
3. Be able to remove the last student's grade from the array.

Write a function for each operation. The program will only exit if the teacher chooses the exit option.


So it will look like
1. Display & Calculate
2. Update
3. Remove
4. Exit
